abstract = {In this paper, we calculate the stable Wigner-Seitz (W-S) cells in the inner crust of neutron stars and we discuss the nuclear shell effects. A distinction is done between the shell effects due to the bound states and those induced by the unbound states, which are shown to be spurious. We then estimate the effects of the spurious shells on the total energy and decompose it into a smooth and a residual part. We propose a correction to the Hartree-Fock binding energy in Wigner-Seitz cell (HF-WS).},

  abstract = {Formed in the aftermath of gravitational core-collapse supernova explosions, neutron stars are unique cosmic laboratories for probing the properties of matter under extreme conditions that cannot be reproduced in terrestrial laboratories. The interior of a neutron star, endowed with the highest magnetic fields known and with densities spanning about ten orders of magnitude from the surface to the centre, is predicted to exhibit various phases of dense strongly interacting matter, whose physics is reviewed in this chapter. The outer layers of a neutron star consist of a solid nuclear crust, permeated by a neutron ocean in its densest region, possibly on top of a nuclear ``pasta'' mantle. The properties of these layers and of the homogeneous isospin asymmetric nuclear matter beneath constituting the outer core may still be constrained by terrestrial experiments. The inner core of highly degenerate, strongly interacting matter poses a few puzzles and questions which are reviewed here together with perspectives for their resolution. Consequences of the dense-matter phases for observables such as the neutron-star mass-radius relationship and the prospects to uncover their structure with modern observational programmes are touched upon.},

  abstract = {Methods. To this end, we have followed the evolution of ashes made of 56Fe employing the nuclear energy-density functional theory. Both the outer and inner crusts are described using the same functional, thus ensuring a unified and thermodynamically consistent treatment. To assess the role of accretion on the structure of the crust, we have employed the set of accurately calibrated Brussels\textendash Montreal functionals BSk19, BSk20, and BSk21, for which the equations of state of nonaccreted neutron stars have been already calculated. These energy-density functionals were fitted to the same set of nuclear masses but were simultaneously adjusted to realistic neutron-matter equations of state with different degrees of stiffness at suprasaturation densities. For comparison, we have also considered the SLy4 functional. Results. Due to nuclear shell effects, the interior of fully accreted crust is found to be much less stratified than in previous studies. In particular, large regions of the inner crust contain clusters with the magic number Z = 14. The heat deposited in the outer crust is tightly constrained by experimental atomic mass data. The shallow heating we obtain does not exceed 0.2 MeV per accreted nucleon and is therefore not enough to explain the cooling of some soft X-ray transients. The total heat released in the crust is very sensitive to details of the nuclear structure and is predicted to lie in the range from 1.5 MeV to 1.7 MeV per accreted nucleon. Conclusions. The evolution of an accreted matter element and therefore the location of heat sources are governed to a large extent by the existence of nuclear shell closures. Ignoring these effects in the inner crust, the total heat falls to {$\sim$}0.6 MeV per accreted nucleon.},

  abstract = {Background: Nuclear pasta, emerging due to the competition between the long-range Coulomb force and the short-range strong force, is believed to be present in astrophysical scenarios, such as neutron stars and corecollapse supernovae. Its structure can have a high impact, e.g., on neutrino transport or the tidal deformability of neutron stars. Purpose: We study several possible pasta configurations, all of them minimal surface configurations, which are expected to appear in the mid-density regime of nuclear pasta, i.e., around 40\% of the nuclear saturation density. In particular we are interested in the energy spectrum for different pasta configurations considered. Method: Employing the density functional theory approach, we calculate the binding energy of the different configurations for three values of the proton content XP = 1/10, 1/3, and 1/2, by optimizing their periodic length. We study finite temperature effects and the impact of electron screening. Results: Nuclear pasta lowers the energy significantly compared to uniform matter, especially for XP 1/3. However, the different configurations have very similar binding energies. For large proton content, XP 1/3, the pasta configurations are very stable, for lower proton content temperatures of a few MeV are enough for the transition to uniform matter. Electron screening has a small influence on the binding energy of nuclear pasta, but increases its periodic length. Conclusion: Nuclear pasta in the mid-density regime lowers the energy of the matter for all proton fractions under study. It can survive even large temperatures of several MeV. Since various configurations have very similar energy, it is to expect that many configurations can coexist simultaneously already at small temperatures.},
